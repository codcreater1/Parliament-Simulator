Parliament Simulator
This project is a basic parliamentary simulation developed in C++. It allows users to create political parties, add members of parliament (MPs) to those parties, propose bills, conduct voting on the bills based on party voting strategies, and display the results.

The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, structs, enums, and vectors. It uses a console-based menu system for user interaction.

During the development, I, Murat Can Nergiz, received assistance from OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT. Throughout the process, I experimented with different methods and design approaches. The main goal was to write clean and understandable C++ code, handle user input, and manage program flow effectively.

To run the program, compile the main.cpp file with a C++ compiler and execute it. You can then use the menu to add parties, MPs, propose bills, and perform voting.

In the future, I plan to add features like saving and loading data from files, implementing more complex voting strategies, allowing MPs to vote independently, and developing a graphical user interface.
